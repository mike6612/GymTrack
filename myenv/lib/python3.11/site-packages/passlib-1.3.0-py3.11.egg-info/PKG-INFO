PassLib is a password hash library, which provides cross-platform
implementations of over 20 password hashing algorithms; as well as a framework for managing
and migrating existing password hashes. It's designed to be useful
for any task from quickly verifying a hash found in /etc/shadow,
to providing full-strength password hashing for multi-user application.
